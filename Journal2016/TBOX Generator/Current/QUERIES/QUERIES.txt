CQ5 -- Which proteins participate in a reproductive processes?
The aim behind this query is to enable the retrieval for only the classes enlisted as participant of a given process.
It may look like unespecific due to the huge amout of results it may have, however as we look for their superclasses, this set is going
to be reduced easily. Additionally, this query requires the usage of taxonomical reasoning (subsumption) in order to retrieve the results.
The class 'sulfur amino acid metabolic' is not directly asserted as participant of this specific process. However, subclasses (deeper in hierarchy)
includes the axioms regarding 

Query: protein and ('is participant in' some 'reproductive process')

CQ8 -- Are there molecular functions exhibited by protein of type 'cysthationine beta-synthase', which are considered dysfunctional?

This query aims at identifying (consistency checking) if a given molecular function is performed by a dysfunctional protein. Considering data does not ensure this type of relation, and that molecular functions available in GO are only canonical ativities from molecules, this kind of statement is not possible.

Considering that, below we present the query:
molecular_function and ('has participant' some ('cystathionine beta-synthase' and ('is bearer of' some Dysfunctional)))

Which returns no subclasses of molecular_function. This show that the ontology is restricted enough in order to disallow the representation of undesired statements.
