CQ1': Which biological processes have proteins of the kind \textit{Prot$_1$} as participants?

DL QUERY: (Functioning)
biological_process and (hasParticipant some Methionine_synthase)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CQ2 --  In which cellular locations is \textit{Prot$_1$} active in organisms of the type  \textit{Org$_1$}? \\ 

cellular_component and (isPartOf some Loxodonta_africana__African_elephant_) and (includes some Cystathionine_beta_synthase__EC_4_2_1_22_)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CQ3 --  Which proteins are involved in processes of the type \textit{BProc$_i1$} in organisms of the type \textit{Org$_i1$}? \\

DL QUERY:
protein and (isParticipantIn some methylation__GO_0032259_) and (isPartOf some Homo_sapiens__Human_)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CQ4 -- Which are the organisms that includes a protein of type X and are also found in situations of type Y?

'cellular organism' and (hasPart some (Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase__EC_1_5_1_20_ and (isParticipantIn some folic_acid_metabolic_process__GO_0046655_)))

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CQ7 -- Are there molecular functions exhibited by protein of type 'cysthationine beta-synthase', which are considered dysfunctional?
